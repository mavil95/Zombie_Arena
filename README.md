# ZombieArena
 
<p>
This is my final work from course "C++ game programming": 
</p>
<b>2D shooter with randomly generated map, randomly generated waves of zombies, and character leveling system.</b>

## Improvements to the outside of the course: 
- Better shooting and reloading system;
- pickup balance and arrows to it;
- better sounds;
- menu and game music;
- hotkeys to rule SFX and music;
- HUD binding to screen resolution;
